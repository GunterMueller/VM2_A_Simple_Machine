                           VM2 Assembler                          Guide to the CodeThe new code this month consists of four modules:    Assembler (MOD file only)   main assembler module    LabelTable                  the label table    ALexAn                      assembler lexical analyzer    LexAnStuff                  lexical analyzer toolkitIn addition, the following modules are from the previous project, the VM2virtual machine:    VM2Defs    OpNames    StringStuff    CharStuff    MyTerminalA couple of sample assembler programs are supplied.  EnterString will readin a string and echo it.  Factorial computes the factorial of a number recursively.I would be interested in hearing about any bugs in this code.  You can contactme at 1643 Cambridge Street #34, Cambridge MA 02138, or on BIX; my nicknameis jba.    Jonathan Amsterdam

[Editor's note:  To put the VM2 Assembler listings on BYTEnet, the filenames had to be 8 characters.  The files for the assembler have been concatenated into one file, Assemble.asc.  You should break out the individual files after downloading Assemble.asc, and compile them individually.  The example files, EnterString.asm and Factorial.asm  come after Assembler.MOD, LabelTable.DEF, LableTable.MOD, AlexAn.DEF, AlexAn.MOD, LexAnStuff.DEF, and LexAnStuff.MOD]
